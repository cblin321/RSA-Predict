As a result of the change in ADS ratio, the price of its ADS is expected to increase proportionally, although BiondVax can give no assurance that the ADS price after the change in ADS ratio will be equal to or greater than ten times the ADS price before the change.",

Kintara is developing two late-stage, Phase 3-ready therapeutics for clear unmet medical needs with reduced risk development programs. The two programs are VAL-083 for glioblastoma (GBM) and REM-001 for cutaneous metastatic breast cancer (CMBC).VAL-083 is a ""first-in-class"", small-molecule chemotherapeutic with a novel mechanism of action that has demonstrated clinical activity against a range of cancers, including central nervous system, ovarian and other solid tumors (e.g., NSCLC, bladder cancer, head and neck) in U.S. clinical trials sponsored by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). Based on Kintara's internal research programs and these prior NCI-sponsored clinical studies, Kintara is currently advancing VAL-083 in the Global Coalition for Adaptive Research registrational Phase 2/3 clinical trial titled Glioblastoma Adaptive Global Innovative Learning Environment (GBM AGILE) Study to support the development and commercialization of VAL-083 in GBM.Kintara also has a proprietary, late-stage PDT platform that holds promise as a localized cutaneous, or visceral, tumor treatment as well as in other potential indications. REM-001 therapy has been previously studied in four Phase 2/3 clinical trials in patients with CMBC who had previously received chemotherapy and/or failed radiation therapy. In CMBC, REM-001 has a clinical efficacy to date of 80% complete responses of CMBC evaluable lesions and an existing robust safety database of approximately 1,100 patients across multiple indications.

By combining sophisticated data science capabilities with highly functional human cell derived disease models, Vyant Bio seeks to leverage its current ability to screen and test therapeutic candidates, and create a unique approach to assimilating data that supports decision making iteratively throughout the discovery phase of drug development to identify both novel and repurposed CNS therapeutic candidates.For more information, please visit or follow Vyant Bio at:Internet:ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ www.vyantbio.com LinkedIn:ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ https://www.linkedin.com/company/vyant-bio Twitter:ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ @VyantBio","CHERRY HILL, N.J., Nov.  01, 2022  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Vyant Bio, Inc.

The Reverse Stock Split will be effective as of 12:01 am on October 28, 2022 (the ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂEffective TimeÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ).

 

As previously described in detail in our definitive proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 29, 2022, the Company held a special meeting of stockholders on September 8, 2022, at which meeting the stockholders approved, among other things, amendment of our Certificate of Incorporation to effect a reverse stock split of our Common Stock at a ratio of not less than 1-for-5 and not more than 1-for-20 and authorized our board of directors to effect a reverse stock split with the exact ratio to be determined in the BoardÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs discretion. Our Board thereafter selected the 1-for-20 reverse stock split ratio and authorized the implementation of the Reverse Stock Split.

 

As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, at the Effective Time, every twenty (20) shares of our pre-Reverse Stock Split Common Stock will be combined and reclassified into one (1) share of our Common Stock. Our post-Reverse Stock Split Common Stock will begin trading on October 28, 2022 with a new CUSIP number of 293602207. The Reverse Stock Split does not affect any stockholderÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs ownership percentage of the Common Stock and does not change our authorized number of shares, alter the par value of the Common Stock or modify any voting rights or other terms of the Common Stock

 

At the Effective Time, the exercise prices and the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the CompanyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs warrants will automatically be adjusted, in accordance with their terms, in proportion to the Reverse Stock Split ratio.

 

As of the Effective Time, proportionate adjustments will be made to the per share exercise price and/or the number of shares issuable upon the exercise or vesting of all stock options and restricted stock unit awards issued by the Company and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Reverse Stock Split, which will result in a proportionate decrease in the number of shares of Common Stock reserved for issuance upon exercise or vesting of such stock options and restricted stock unit awards, and a proportionate increase in the exercise price of all such stock options and restricted stock unit awards. Concurrently, the number of shares reserved for issuance under the CompanyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Amended and Restated 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan immediately prior to the effective time of the Reverse Stock Split will be reduced proportionately.

 

No fractional shares will be issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split. In lieu of the issuance of fractional shares, the Company will round up any fractional shares resulting from the Reverse Stock Split to the nearest whole share.

The Company noted that it has not received any notice or indication from the NYSE American, the exchange on which its common stock is currently listed, which would necessitate a reverse stock split.The CompanyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs common stock will begin trading on a split-adjusted basis when the market opens on October 18, 2022. The reverse stock split was authorized by the CompanyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Board of Directors on September 8, 2022. Pursuant to the laws of the State of Nevada, the CompanyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs state of incorporation, the CompanyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Board of Directors has the authority to effect a reverse stock split without shareholder approval if the number of authorized shares of common stock and the number of outstanding shares of common stock are proportionally reduced. The Company will file a certificate of change to its articles of incorporation, as amended, with the Secretary of State of Nevada to effect the reverse stock split.As a result of the reverse split, each ten (10) pre-split shares of common stock outstanding will automatically combine into one (1) new share of common stock without any action on the part of the holders, and the number of outstanding common shares will be reduced from 32,324,670 shares to 3,232,467 shares.No fractional shares will be issued as a result of the reverse stock split.

ir@airindustriesgroup.com","BAY SHORE, N.Y., October 04, 2022--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Air Industries Group (NYSE American: AIRI), an integrated Tier 1 manufacturer of precision assemblies and components for mission-critical aerospace and defense applications, and a prime contractor to the U.S. Department of Defense, today announced a reverse stock split of its issued and outstanding common stock, par value $0.001 per share, at a ratio of one (1) share of common stock for every ten (10) shares of common stock, effective as of 12:01 a.m. (Eastern Time) on October 18, 2022 (the ""Effective Date"").While the Company noted that forward and reverse stock splits do not change the actual ownership percentages nor have a net effect on the usual valuation yardsticks used by investors, the Air Industries Board of Directors hopes the resulting nominal increase in the price of the shares may have the effect of broadening the base of potential investors. The Company noted that it has not received any notice or indication from the NYSE American, the exchange on which its common stock is currently listed, which would necessitate a reverse stock split.The CompanyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs common stock will begin trading on a split-adjusted basis when the market opens on October 18, 2022. The reverse stock split was authorized by the CompanyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Board of Directors on September 8, 2022. Pursuant to the laws of the State of Nevada, the CompanyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs state of incorporation, the CompanyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Board of Directors has the authority to effect a reverse stock split without shareholder approval if the number of authorized shares of common stock and the number of outstanding shares of common stock are proportionally reduced. The Company will file a certificate of change to its articles of incorporation, as amended, with the Secretary of State of Nevada to effect the reverse stock split.As a result of the reverse split, each ten (10) pre-split shares of common stock outstanding will automatically combine into one (1) new share of common stock without any action on the part of the holders, and the number of outstanding common shares will be reduced from 32,324,670 shares to 3,232,467 shares.No fractional shares will be issued as a result of the reverse stock split. Shareholders who otherwise would be entitled to a fractional share because they hold a number of shares not evenly divisible by the 1 (one) for ten (10) reverse split ratio, will automatically be entitled to receive an additional fractional share of the CompanyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs common stock to round up to the next whole share.The CompanyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs transfer agent, Broadridge Corporate Issuer Solutions, Inc., which is also acting as the exchange agent for the reverse split, will send instructions to stockholders of record who hold stock certificates regarding the exchange of their old certificates for new certificates, should they wish to do so.

A post-effective amendment to the ADS Registration Statement on Form F-6 will be filed with the SEC to reflect the change in the ADS Ratio. The Company anticipates that the change in the ADS Ratio will be effective on or about October 17, 2022 (U.S. Eastern Time), subject to the effectiveness of the post-effective amendment to the ADS Registration Statement on Form F-6 on or before that date.Each ADS holder of record at the close of business on the date when the change in ADS Ratio is effective will be required to surrender and exchange every thirty (30) existing ADSs then held for one (1) new ADS. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as the depositary bank for MissfreshÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs ADS program, will arrange for the exchange of the current ADSs for the new ones. MissfreshÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs ADSs will continue to be traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the symbol ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂMF.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂNo fractional new ADSs will be issued in connection with the change in the ADS Ratio. Instead, fractional entitlements to new ADSs will be aggregated and sold by the depositary bank and the net cash proceeds from the sale of the fractional ADS entitlements (after deduction of fees, taxes and expenses) will be distributed to the applicable ADS holders by the depositary bank. The change in the ADS Ratio will have no impact on MissfreshÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs underlying Class B ordinary shares, and no Class B ordinary shares will be issued or cancelled in connection with the change in the ADS Ratio.As a result of the change in the ADS Ratio, the ADS trading price is expected to increase proportionally, although the Company can give no assurance that the ADS trading price after the change in the ADS Ratio will be equal to or greater than 30 times the ADS trading price before the change. As previously announced on June 4, 2022, the Company received a notification letter from the Nasdaq Stock Market dated June 2, 2022, regarding its ADS trading price.

A post-effective amendment to the ADS Registration Statement on Form F-6 will be filed with the SEC to reflect the change in the ADS Ratio. The Company anticipates that the change in the ADS Ratio will be effective on or about October 17, 2022 (U.S. Eastern Time), subject to the effectiveness of the post-effective amendment to the ADS Registration Statement on Form F-6 on or before that date.Each ADS holder of record at the close of business on the date when the change in ADS Ratio is effective will be required to surrender and exchange every thirty (30) existing ADSs then held for one (1) new ADS. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as the depositary bank for MissfreshÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs ADS program, will arrange for the exchange of the current ADSs for the new ones.

Instead, fractional entitlements to new ADSs will be aggregated and sold by the depositary bank and the net cash proceeds from the sale of the fractional ADS entitlements (after deduction of fees, taxes and expenses) will be distributed to the applicable ADS holders by the depositary bank. The change in the ADS Ratio will have no impact on MissfreshÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs underlying Class B ordinary shares, and no Class B ordinary shares will be issued or cancelled in connection with the change in the ADS Ratio.As a result of the change in the ADS Ratio, the ADS trading price is expected to increase proportionally, although the Company can give no assurance that the ADS trading price after the change in the ADS Ratio will be equal to or greater than 30 times the ADS trading price before the change. As previously announced on June 4, 2022, the Company received a notification letter from the Nasdaq Stock Market dated June 2, 2022, regarding its ADS trading price.

Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Catheter Precision will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Ra Medical in a stock-for-stock reverse merger transaction (the ""Merger""). If completed, the Merger will result in a combined publicly traded company that will focus on the cardiac electrophysiology market, one of the most robust and growing areas of medical devices.Catheter Precision has three product areas that it intends to pursue. Its lead product, named VIVOÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ (an acronym for View Into Ventricular Onset) is an FDA-cleared and CE mark product that utilizes non-invasive inputs to locate the origin of ventricular arrhythmias, and, through its use, the physician can identify patients for invasive catheter ablation, and with those patients, reduce the amount of time in the invasive procedure. Ventricular arrhythmias include ventricular tachyarrhythmias and premature ventricular arrhythmias, diseases that affect millions of patients who are not well treated today. While much past growth in the electrophysiology market has been for atrial fibrillation, Catheter Precision believes that ventricular arrhythmias represent a large growth area moving forward. It also intends to pursue a second generation of AmigoÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ, a robotic arm previously cleared by the FDA and awarded the CE mark, which serves as a catheter control device that can be remotely controlled outside of the procedure room. Catheter Precision has demonstrated that patient outcomes could potentially be enhanced by utilization of this device. Catheter Precision is working toward a third product release in the first half of 2023, which is a vessel closure device that would assist in the closure of the insertion site of the percutaneous catheter or other device used within the body. It is estimated that the worldwide market for this closure assist device is over one million procedures per year.Medtech veteran David Jenkins, who has extensive experience growing medical device start-ups, will serve as Chief Executive Officer of the combined company. Before taking the role as CEO of Catheter Precision, Mr. Jenkins was instrumental in operating several medical device start-ups, including Transneuronix, Inc., which was acquired by Medtronic plc (NYSE: MDT) for $267 million in July 2005, and EP MedSystems, Inc., which was acquired by St. Jude Medical for $95.7 million in July 2008.The Merger is expected to close before the end of 2022, subject to satisfying certain closing conditions, including the receipt of shareholder approval by both companies.

The new CUSIP number for the common stock following the reverse stock split will be 74933X 302.The reverse stock split supports maintenance of the CompanyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs NYSE American listing. On September 2, 2022, Ra Medical announced receipt of a notice that the NYSE American LLC had determined the CompanyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs securities had been selling at a low price per share for a substantial period of time.

Based on these data, we intend to move rapidly to initiate the randomized portion of our Phase 2 SELECT-AML-1 trial, while also continuing to enroll patients in SELECT-MDS-1, where we are evaluating the combination of tamibarotene with standard-of-care azacitidine in patients with higher-risk myelodysplastic syndrome and RARA gene overexpression.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ

Encouraging Initial Data from SELECT-AML-1 Phase 2 Trial
As of October 13, 2022, eight newly diagnosed, unfit, RARA-positive patients had been enrolled in the trial, including six who were evaluable for response. The median age of the patients was 61 (ranging from 55-82) and the median percent blasts at baseline was 63% (ranging from 39-100%).

Initial Safety Data
- Tamibarotene in combination with venetoclax and azacitidine administered at approved doses showed no evidence of increased toxicity relative to the doublet combination of venetoclax and azacitidine. This includes rates of myelosuppression, which were comparable to reports with venetoclax and azacitidine in this population.
- Serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in all six patients. The most frequently occurring SAEs included febrile neutropenia (66%) and pneumonia (50%).
- The majority of non-hematologic AEs were low grade and reversible. The most frequently occurring non-hematologic AEs included pneumonia (66%), cough (50%), anxiety (50%), decreased appetite (50%) and rash (50%).

Initial Clinical Activity Data
- The complete response (CR) and complete response with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) rate, as defined by Revised International Working Group (IWG) criteria was 83%, consisting of two patients (33%) who achieved a CR and three patients (50%) who achieved a CRi.
ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ° Four of five patients (80%) who achieved a CR or CRi had a high monocytic expression score (MES), which may be associated with venetoclax resistance.1
- Median time to CR/CRi response was 33 days (ranging from 25-88).
- Median duration of treatment was 76.5 days (ranging from 20-104) and median duration of follow-up was 107 days (ranging from 56-314).
- These early data compare favorably to the standard-of-care combination of venetoclax and azacitidine, which shows composite CR rates of 66% in newly diagnosed unfit AML patients.2

Advancing Tamibarotene in Newly Diagnosed Unfit AML
Based on the encouraging data reported today, Syros plans to advance into the randomized portion of the SELECT-AML-1 Phase 2 trial, which will evaluate the safety and efficacy of tamibarotene in combination with venetoclax and azacitidine in approximately 80 patients positive for RARA overexpression randomized 1:1 to treatment with tamibarotene and venetoclax/azacitidine vs. venetoclax/azacitidine. The trial will incorporate venetoclax dose modification guidelines based on the recently published European LeukemiaNet (ELN) recommendations,3 and will also evaluate the triplet regimen as a salvage therapy in patients who do not respond to venetoclax and azacitidine in the control arm. The randomized portion is expected to initiate in Q1 2023, with data expected in 2023 or 2024.

The ASH presentation is now available on the Publications and Abstracts section of the Syros website at www.syros.com.

Conference Call Information

Syros will host a conference call at 12:00 p.m. ET today to discuss these data, as well as review the unmet need in newly diagnosed, unfit AML. In addition to Syros management, the event will feature a presentation from Daniel Pollyea, M.D., M.S., Associate Professor of Medicine, Clinical Director of Leukemia Services, University of Colorado School of Medicine.

Globally, pancreatic cancer accounts for over 430,000 deaths each year, including over 48,000 in the United States. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by marked desmoplasia that creates a dense capsule or stroma around the tumor that contributes to drug resistance due, in part, to poor anti-cancer drug delivery to tumor tissue.About CEND-1CEND-1 is an investigational drug that modifies the tumor microenvironment. It is targeted to tumor vasculature by its affinity forÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ alpha-v integrins that are selectively expressed in tumor but not healthy tissue vasculature. CEND-1 is a cyclic peptide that, once bound to these integrins, is cleaved by proteases expressed in the tumor microenvironment to release a peptide fragment, called a CendR fragment, which binds to a second receptor, neuropilin-1, to activate a novel uptake pathway (the CendR pathway) that allows anti-cancer drugs to penetrate solid tumors. The ability of CEND-1 to modify the tumor microenvironment to enhance delivery and efficacy of co-administered drugs has been demonstrated in models of a range of solid tumors. CEND-1 has also been shown in animal models of pancreatic and other cancers to alter the tumor microenvironment to decrease immunosuppression selectively within the tumor, which may enable a patientÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs immune system and immunotherapies to fight cancer with greater effectiveness.About Caladrius BiosciencesCaladrius Biosciences, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of innovative therapies designed to treat or reverse disease.

We are an e-commerce business with a product portfolio that currently consists of a sonic-powered electric toothbrush kit and brush head refills. We developed the product to make upgrading to an electric brush appealing with three core priorities in mind: (i) a high-quality electric toothbrush at a more affordable price than a comparable electric toothbrush from the competition; (ii) a sleek, countertop-friendly design; and (iii) a convenient brush head refill subscription program that eliminates the frustrating experience of purchasing replacement brush heads at the grocery/drug store. Later this year, we plan to expand our portfolio with the launch of several new subscription-based consumable oral care products, including toothpaste, mouthwash, dental floss, a whitening pen, as well as an electric toothbrush designed for kids. We are rooted in building a brand that creates relevant experiences and content, with the goal of becoming the go-to oral care brand for millennials and Generation Z.For more information on BrÃÂÃÂ¼ush visit: https://bruush.comFollow BrÃÂÃÂ¼ush on LinkedIn: BruushFollow BrÃÂÃÂ¼ush on Instagram: @bruush",,

VIRAGE is expected to enroll up to 92 adult participants at up to 25 sites across the US, Spain, and Germany. In both the control and treatment arms, patients will receive gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel standard of care chemotherapy over 28-day cycles. In the treatment arm only, patients will also receive systemically administered VCN-01 seven-days prior to the first and fourth cycles of gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel treatment. Primary endpoints for the trial include overall survival and VCN-01 safety/tolerability. Additional endpoints include progression free survival, objective response rate, and measures of biodistribution, VCN-01 replication, and immune response. Since this is an open label trial, progress will be monitored very closely and steps to accelerate the clinical program may be implemented if supported by the emerging data.

Patients were randomized 1:1 to 0.95 mg/kg belamaf every three weeks (Q3W, low-dose) combined with 100 mg twice daily nirogacestat or belamaf 2.5 mg/kg Q3W monotherapy.Initial results from the pre-planned interim analysis were presented at the 2022 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting. Updated data from a randomized cohort expansion in which 34 patients received low-dose belamaf plus nirogacestat and 37 patients received belamaf monotherapy will be presented at EHA. Patients had a median of 5 (range 3-14) prior lines of therapy. As of the December 9, 2022 data cut-off, patients received a median of 4 (range 1-20) cycles of the combination and a median of 3 (range 1-9) monotherapy cycles.Overall response rate (ORR) in the low-dose belamaf (0.95 mg/kg Q3W) plus nirogacestat arm was 29%, with 1 patient (3%) achieving a complete response (CR), 5 patients (15%) achieving a very good partial response (VGPR), and 4 patients (12%) achieving a partial response (PR). ORR in the belamaf monotherapy arm (2.5 mg/kg Q3W) was 38%, with no patient achieving a CR, 5 patients (14%) achieving a VGPR, and 9 patients (24%) achieving a PR. Per the prespecified analysis plan, ORR was also calculated incorporating prior ORR for low-dose belamaf plus nirogacestat from the dose exploration cohort of this DREAMM-5 sub-study 3 and from the DREAMM-2 belamaf monotherapy study; ORR across these studies was 36% in the low-dose belamaf plus nirogacestat combination arm and 33% in the belamaf monotherapy arm.Safety results showed a substantial reduction of high-grade ocular events in the low-dose belamaf plus nirogacestat arm compared to the monotherapy arm of belamaf at a higher dose. Specifically, Grade 3 ocular events were 29% for low-dose belamaf + nirogacestat versus 59% for belamaf monotherapy (per the KVA scale); no Grade 4 ocular events or new toxicities occurred in either arm.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂThese clinical data suggest that combining nirogacestat with a low dose of belamaf may result in comparable efficacy to a higher monotherapy belamaf dose, while simultaneously substantially reducing the frequency high-grade ocular adverse events,ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ said Jim Cassidy, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Medical Officer of SpringWorks.

In addition, one patient had Grade 3 CRS and one patient had Grade 3 confusional state. These events led to the decision to delay the starting dose of nirogacestat in subsequent cohorts. In the dose level 2 and dose level 3 cohorts, when nirogacestat was added after teclistamab step-up dosing and reduced to once daily, no dose-limiting toxicities or Grade 3 CRS or neurologic adverse events were reported.The overall response rate was 71% for dose level 1, 57% for dose level 2, and 92% for dose level 3. The total ORR across the three dose levels was 78% and all responses were VGPR or better.

Nirogacestat is an investigational drug for which safety and efficacy have not been established.Gamma secretase cleaves multiple transmembrane protein complexes, including Notch, which is believed to play a role in activating pathways that contribute to growth of desmoid and ovarian granulosa cell tumors. Gamma secretase has also been shown to directly cleave membrane-bound B cell maturation antigen (BCMA), resulting in the release of the BCMA extracellular domain (ECD) from the cell surface. By inhibiting gamma secretase, membrane-bound BCMA can be preserved, increasing target density while reducing levels of soluble BCMA ECD, which may serve as decoy receptors for BCMA-directed therapies. NirogacestatÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs ability to enhance the activity of BCMA-directed therapies has been observed in preclinical models of multiple myeloma. SpringWorks is evaluating nirogacestat as a BCMA potentiator and has several collaborations with industry-leading BCMA developers to evaluate nirogacestat in combinations across modalities. SpringWorks has also formed research collaborations with Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute to further characterize the ability of nirogacestat to modulate BCMA and potentiate BCMA-directed therapies using a variety of preclinical multiple myeloma models.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted a New Drug Application (NDA) for nirogacestat for the treatment of adults with desmoid tumors, which is being reviewed under the FDA's Real-Time Oncology Review program. The NDA was granted Priority Review designation and has been given a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action date of August 27, 2023. The FDA also granted Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy Designations to nirogacestat for the treatment of adult patients with progressive, unresectable, recurrent or refractory desmoid tumors or deep fibromatosis. In addition, nirogacestat has received Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA for the treatment of desmoid tumors and from the European Commission for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma.About SpringWorks TherapeuticsSpringWorks is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company applying a precision medicine approach to acquiring, developing and commercializing life-changing medicines for patients living with severe rare diseases and cancer.

A series of alternate amendments to effect a reverse stock split was approved by the CompanyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs stockholders at the CompanyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on June 10, 2022, and the specific one-for-eight (1-for-8) reverse stock split was subsequently approved by the CompanyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs board of directors on June 10, 2022.
The Amendment provides that, at the effective time of the Amendment, every eight (8) shares of the CompanyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs issued and outstanding common stock will automatically be combined into one issued and outstanding share of common stock, without any change in par value per share. The reverse stock split will affect all shares of the CompanyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Amendment.

The Company will file a post-effective amendment to its registration statement on Form F-6 with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂSECÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ) to reflect the change in the ADS ratio. The effect of the ratio change on the CompanyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs ADS trading price on the New York Stock Exchange (the ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂNYSEÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ) is expected to take place on or about June 21, 2022 (U.S. Eastern Time).
Each ADS holder of record at the close of business on the date when the change in the ADS ratio is effective will be required to surrender their ADSs to the CompanyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs depositary bank, Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, for cancellation and exchange in the ratio of every twenty (20) existing ADSs for one (1) new ADS. Four Seasons EducationÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs ADSs will continue to be traded on the NYSE under the symbol ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂFEDUÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ.
No fractional new ADSs will be issued in connection with the change in the ADS ratio. Instead, fractional entitlements to new ADSs will be aggregated and sold by the depositary bank and the net cash proceeds from the sale of the fractional ADS entitlements (after deduction of fees, taxes and expenses) will be distributed to the applicable ADS holders by the depositary bank.",,

On March 15, 2023, the Company announced that it was undergoing a review of strategic alternatives that could include a strategic sale, a merger or reverse merger, implementing a reverse stock split for the purposes of up-listing to NASDAQ, seeking additional financing or some combination of the aforementioned scenarios. The Company believes that effecting the reverse split at this time, given the low trading price of the CompanyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs common stock, would best position the Company in pursuing any alternatives that result from the strategic review. The Company believes that having a consistently low share price makes the Company less attractive to potential strategic partners and renders it impossible to consider an up-listing to Nasdaq.

(NYSE: ZEV), a leading provider of zero emission medium-duty commercial vehicles and electric vehicle technology for fleets, announced today that its Board of Directors approved a 1-for-20 reverse stock split of its issued and outstanding shares of common stock, effective at 5 p.m. Eastern Time on April 27, 2023. Beginning on April 28, 2023, the companyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs common stock with the ticker symbol ""ZEV"" will trade on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on a split-adjusted basis under the new CUSIP 53228T 200.Upon the effectiveness of the reverse stock split, every twenty shares of common stock issued and outstanding will automatically be converted into one share of common stock. No fractional shares will be issued in connection with the reverse stock split. Stockholders who otherwise would be entitled to receive fractional shares because they hold a number of shares of common stock not evenly divisible by the reverse stock split ratio will automatically be entitled to receive a cash payment equal to the value of the fractional share.The reverse stock split will not reduce the number of authorized shares of common stock or change the par value of the common stock. The reverse stock split will affect all stockholders uniformly and will not affect any stockholder's ownership percentage of the company's shares of common stock. The common stock issued pursuant to the reverse stock split will remain fully paid and non-assessable. All outstanding options, warrants, restricted stock units, and similar securities entitling their holders to receive or purchase shares of common stock will be proportionally adjusted as a result of the reverse stock split, both in terms of their exercise prices and as well as to the number of underlying shares, as required by the terms of each security. Prior to the reverse stock split, the Company had outstanding issued warrants listed on the NYSE to purchase a total of 14,999,970 shares of common stock, with each whole warrant being exercisable to purchase one share of common stock at $11.50 per share. After giving effect to the reverse stock split, these warrants are now exercisable for a total of approximately 749,998 shares of common stock, resulting in each warrant becoming exercisable for 1/20th of a share of common stock with an exercise price of $230.00 per whole share.Stockholders who hold shares electronically in book-entry form with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company (""CST""), the Company's transfer agent, will not need to take action to receive evidence of their shares of post-Reverse Stock Split common stock.Additional information about the reverse stock split can be found in the Company's definitive proxy statement (the ""Proxy Statement"") filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") on December 27, 2022 which is available free of charge at the SEC's website, www.sec.gov.",,1802749.0

Split will be rounded down to the nearest whole share of Common Stock, provided further, that shareholders who would otherwise be entitled to receive
fractional shares because they hold a number of shares not evenly divisible by the ratio of the Reverse Stock Split will receive a cash payment (without
interest and subject to applicable withholding taxes) in an amount per share equal to the closing price per share of Common Stock on Nasdaq on April 25,
2023, a day preceding the effectiveness of the Reverse Stock Split on Nasdaq.
Except for de minimus adjustments that resulted from the treatment of fractional shares, the Reverse Stock Split did will not have any dilutive effect on our
shareholders, since each shareholder holds the same percentage of our Common Stock outstanding immediately following the Reverse Stock Split as such
shareholder held immediately prior to the Reverse Stock Split.

Cerminara added, ""As a public company, we would like to make it easier to own shares.

We hope this action will ease that burden.""At the effective time of the reverse stock split, every five (5) shares of issued and outstanding common stock will be exchanged for one (1) share of common stock, with all fractional shares being rounded up to the nearest whole share. The reverse stock split will reduce the number of issued and outstanding shares of common stock from approximately 17 million pre-split shares to approximately 3.4 million post-split shares.

As previously described in detail in our definitive proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 24, 2023, the
Company held a special meeting of stockholders on March 23, 2023, at which meeting the stockholders approved an amendment of our Certificate of
Incorporation to effect a reverse stock split of our Common Stock at a ratio of not less than 1-for-5 and not more than 1-for-12 and authorized our board of
directors to effect a reverse stock split with the exact ratio to be determined in the Board of Directors (ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂBoardÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ) discretion. The Board thereafter authorized
a 1-for-12 reverse stock split ratio and directed the implementation of the Reverse Stock Split.
As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, at the Effective Time, every twelve (12) shares of our pre-Reverse Stock Split Common Stock will be
combined and reclassified into one (1) share of our Common Stock. Our post-Reverse Stock Split Common Stock will begin trading on March 31, 2023

automatically be adjusted, in accordance with their terms, in proportion to the Reverse Stock Split ratio.
As of the Effective Time, proportionate adjustments will be made to the per share exercise price and/or the number of shares issuable upon the
exercise or vesting of all stock options and restricted stock unit awards issued by the Company and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of
the Reverse Stock Split, which will result in a proportionate decrease in the number of shares of Common Stock reserved for issuance upon exercise or
vesting of such stock options and restricted stock unit awards, and a proportionate increase in the exercise price of all such stock options and restricted
stock unit awards. Concurrently, the number of shares reserved for issuance under the CompanyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Amended and Restated 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan

No fractional shares will be issued as a result of the reverse share split. Shareholders who otherwise would be entitled to a fractional share because
they hold a number of ordinary shares not evenly divisible by the one (1) for 10 reverse split ratio, will automatically be entitled to receive an additional
fractional share of Freight Technologies Inc. ordinary shares to round up to the next whole share if they were to hold a fractional share equal to one-half or
more. Shareholders who hold a fractional share equal to less than one-half will have the fractional share cancelled",,1687542.0

(NASDAQ:CUEN)(NASDAQ:CUENW) (""Cuentas"" or the ""Company""), a leading fintech provider of mobile financial app and payment solutions, today announced that the company's Board of Directors has approved a reverse stock split of its shares of common stock at a ratio of 1 for 13 (the ""Reverse Stock Split""). The Reverse Stock Split will become effective at 12:01 a.m. Eastern time on March 24, 2023 and the Company's common stock will open for trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market on a post-split basis on March 24, 2023 under the Company's existing trading symbol ""CUEN"". At such time, the Company's common stock will also commence trading under a new CUSIP number 229794300.We expect that the Reverse Stock Split will increase the market price per share of the Company's common stock, bringing the Company into compliance with listing requirements for The Nasdaq Capital Market.At the effective time of the Reverse Stock Split, every thirteen (13) shares of Cuentas common stock issued and outstanding will be combined into one (1) share of common stock issued and outstanding, with no change to the par value of $0.001 per share. This will reduce the Company's outstanding common stock from approximately 27.1 million shares to approximately 2.1 million shares. Fractional shares resulting from the Reverse Stock Split will be rounded up to the nearest whole share, and all currently issued shares of common stock held by a shareholder shall be aggregated for the purpose of determining whether the Reverse Stock Split would result in the issuance of a fractional share. The Reverse Stock Split will also result in an adjustment to the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Company's outstanding equity awards and warrants and a corresponding adjustment to the exercise prices of such securities. The actual number of warrants issued and outstanding will not be adjusted as a result of the Reverse Stock Split (i.e., each one (1) warrant will be exercisable into one-thirteenth of a share of common stock following the Reverse Stock Split).Stockholders of record holding physical certificates representing pre-split shares of the Company's common stock as of the effective date may contact the Company's transfer agent, Olde Monmouth Stock Transfer Co., Inc., if they would like to exchange their certificate for a new certificate representing the post-split share amount. While this is not required, your physical certificate will contain the old CUSIP number and will not be transferrable until it is exchanged for a new certificate. Registered stockholders holding pre-split shares of the Company's common stock electronically in book-entry form are not required to take any action to receive post-split shares. Stockholders owning shares via a broker, bank, trust or other nominee will have their positions automatically adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split, subject to such broker's particular processes, and will not be required to take any action in connection with the Reverse Stock Split.

Proportionate adjustments will be made to the exercise prices and the number of shares underlying the Company's outstanding equity awards, as applicable, as well as to the number of shares issuable under the Company's equity incentive plans and certain existing agreements. The Common Stock issued pursuant to the reverse stock split will remain fully paid and non-assessable.

No new Shares will be issued in connection with the Ratio Change and the ADSs will continue to be traded on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂVEON.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ

As a result of the Ratio Change, the trading price of the CompanyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs ADSs is expected to automatically increase proportionally, but the Company can give no assurance that the ADS trading price following the Ratio Change will be at least equal to the ADS trading price before the Ratio Change multiplied by the new 25:1 ratio. As VEON announced previously on 5 October 2022, the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Market granted VEON an additional grace period through 3 April 2023 to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement set forth in NasdaqÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂMinimum Bid PriceÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ). While the Ratio Change is intended to bring the bid price of the CompanyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs ADSs into compliance with the Minimum Bid Price, the Company can give no assurance that the Ratio Change will be effective in achieving this goal.

As a result, no fractional shares will be issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split and no cash or other consideration will be paid in connection with any fractional shares that would otherwise have resulted from the Reverse Stock Split.The Reverse Stock Split has no effect on the par value of the CompanyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Common Stock or authorized shares of preferred stock.

The rights and privileges of the holders of shares of Common Stock will be substantially unaffected by the Reverse Stock Split.The Reverse Stock Split is primarily being effected to regain compliance with the $1.00 minimum bid price required for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2).Stockholders who are holding their shares in electronic form at brokerage firms do not need to take any action, as the effect of the Reverse Stock Split will automatically be reflected in their brokerage accounts.

Reverse Stock Split, the number of issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Reverse Stock Split was reduced
to a smaller number of shares, such that every seven shares of Company Common Stock held by a stockholder immediately prior to the Reverse Stock
Split were combined and reclassified into one share of Company Common Stock.
No fractional shares were issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split. Each stockholder who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share
of Company Common Stock upon the Reverse Stock Split (after aggregating all fractions of a share to which such stockholder would otherwise be
entitled) was, in lieu thereof, entitled to receive a cash payment determined by multiplying the closing price of the Company Common Stock on the
Nasdaq Stock Market on the date immediately preceding the date the Reverse Stock Split became effective, by the fraction of a share of Company
Common Stock to which each stockholder would otherwise be entitled.",,1445283.0

The most recent SPINs data2 indicates a significant year over year improvement in measured channels with dollar sales increasing 38.0%, total distribution points expanding 19.0%, price-mix improving 12.5%, and ultimately earning 15.1 basis points of category share. These key metrics are indicative of the growing strength of our brands, our retail partnerships, and the positive response from our expanding consumer base.ÃÂÃÂÃÂThe Company anticipates reporting greatly improved gross margins year-over-year as a result of pricing, product mix, and productivity; however, a slight decrease in gross margins on a sequential basis is expected for the quarter.Based on the information currently available, the Company estimates that its Adjusted EBITDA Loss3 will be within a range of $2.4 million to $2.7 million representing a year-over-year improvement of $8.7 million to $9.0 million from the prior year quarter as well as a $0.8 million to $1.1 million reduction in Adjusted EBITDA Loss when compared to the first quarter of 2023 on a sequential basis.

We anticipate that the progress made, as supported by the retail metrics, will help to deliver our future growth initiatives and expectations.

297.0,2023-08-28,FFIE,Faraday Future Intelligent Electric Inc.,1 for 80,"LOS ANGELES, August 25, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Faraday Future Intelligent Electric Inc. (NASDAQ: FFIE) (""Faraday Future"", ""FF"" or ""Company""), a California-based global shared intelligent electric mobility ecosystem company, today announced that the Company effected a reverse stock split of the issued and outstanding shares of the Companyâs common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the ""common stock""), at a ratio of 1-for-80 (the ""reverse stock split""). The effective time of the reverse stock split will be 5:00 p.m. ET on August 25, 2023. The Companyâs common stock will begin trading on a split-adjusted basis commencing upon market open on August 28, 2023.As previously disclosed, at the Companyâs Special Meeting of Stockholders held on August 16, 2023, the Companyâs stockholders voted to approve a proposal authorizing the Board of Directors of the Company (the ""Board"") to amend the Companyâs Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (the ""Charter""), to effect a reverse stock split of the Companyâs common stock. In addition, at the Special Meeting, the Companyâs stockholders voted to approve a proposal authorizing the Board to further amend the Charter if, and only if, the reverse stock split was approved and the Board implements the reverse stock split at a ratio of one-for-eight or greater, to limit the number of shares of authorized common stock to a number equal to 12,355,000,000 divided by the reverse stock split ratio determined by the Board. On August 22, 2023, the Board approved a 1-for-80 reverse stock split. As a result of the reverse split, each 80 shares of the Companyâs issued and outstanding common stock will be automatically combined and converted into one issued and outstanding share of common stock. The Companyâs Class A common stock will trade under a new CUSIP number, 307359 505, effective August 28, 2023, and remain listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol ""FFIE."" The Companyâs publicly traded warrants will continue to be traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol ""FFIEW"" and the CUSIP number for the warrants will remain unchanged. However, under the terms of the applicable warrant agreement, the number of shares of Class A Common Stock issuable on exercise of each warrant will be proportionately decreased. Specifically, following effectiveness of the Reverse Stock Split, every 80 shares of Class A Common Stock that may be purchased pursuant to the exercise of public warrants now represents one share of Class A Common Stock that may be purchased pursuant to such warrants. Accordingly, for the Companyâs warrants trading under the symbol ""FFIEW"", every 80 warrants will be exercisable for one share of Class A Common Stock at an exercise price of $920.00 per share of Class A Common Stock. The reverse stock split reduces the number of shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion of the Companyâs outstanding convertible securities, and the exercise or vesting of its outstanding stock options, restricted stock units and private warrants in proportion to the ratio of the reverse stock split and causes a proportionate increase in the conversion and exercise prices of such convertible securities, stock options, restricted stock units and private warrants. In addition, the authorized shares of Common Stock will be reduced from 1,765,000,000 to 154,437,500.No fractional shares of common stock will be issued as a result of the reverse stock split. Stockholders of record who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fractional share will be entitled to receive from the Company one full share of the post-reverse stock split common stock. The reverse stock split impacts all holders of the Companyâs common stock proportionally and will not impact any stockholderâs percentage ownership of the Company common stock.Faraday Future has chosen its transfer agent, Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, to act as exchange agent for the reverse stock split. Stockholders owning shares via a bank, broker or other nominee will have their positions automatically adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split and will not be required to take further action in connection with the reverse stock split, subject to brokersâ particular processes.Additional information about the Reverse Stock Split and the related Charter amendment can be found in the Companyâs definitive proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 20, 2023.ABOUT FARADAY FUTUREFF is the pioneer of the Ultimate Intelligent TechLuxury ultra spire market in the intelligent EV era, and a disruptor of the traditional ultra-luxury car industry.
